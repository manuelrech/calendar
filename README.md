## Introduction
This is a fun project used to scrape data for lesson in the univesity website (University of Bologna) and save the calendar to the iOS calendar.

### Libraries
I have used `selenium` to interact with the webpage and scrape lectures data and [`icalendar`](https://pypi.org/project/icalendar/) to manage the events
